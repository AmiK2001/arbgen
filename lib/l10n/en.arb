    "buildHabitTip": "    The habit builder is based on cutting edge research in cognitive science. The more fields you fill in, the easier it will be to stick to new behavior.\n    We suggest that you use a habit loop to build desired routines. The habit loop has 3 steps - cue (trigger), routine, and reward. So find the right trigger for your new habit, describe the routine including mindset and challenges, and determine the ideal reinforcement... and this time you'll nail it!",
    "breakHabitTip": "    The decision to change a behavior takes place in the prefrontal cortex, the area of planning. But the automatic behavior of the habit itself is stored in another area - the basal ganglia. That is why the habit-breaking process can be difficult.\n    You will need to give your brain some time to adjust. The most effective way to break a bad habit is to replace it with a good one. As you see rewards gradually begin to accumulate from the new, good habit — the desire to continue this behavior will outweigh the desire to pursue the old habit.",
    "customGoalTip": "    Use two great goal-setting frameworks that will move you from dreaming and planning towards reaching your goals:\n    • SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)\n    • OKR (Objectives and Key Results)\n    Divide big goals into parts and then into tasks and habits. Keep in mind that the better you describe your goal, the clearer it becomes for your brain, which drives your motivation.",
    "focusTimerTip": "    This focus timer is based on the Pomodoro technique. It's a simple tool to manage time and avoid distractions.\n    1. In the \"My day\" tab choose any tasks you'd like to get done.\n    2. Set a 25-min timer or adjust the time to your needs.\n    3. Concentrate on the task until the timer rings.\n    4. Take a short break and get inspiration from the break tips.\n    5. Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 min).",
    "myDayHabitsTip": "    Once we decide to change our lifestyle, we often want to tackle all of our dreams and problems at once. But working on too many habits simultaneously is not an easy task.

    "onboardingGoalsTip": "    Setting goals and achieving them is the set of cognitive skills that can be practiced. SMART goals help people define and implement intentions in any sphere - health, business, or education. The SMART criteria incorporate guidance and realistic direction in goal setting, which increases motivation and leads to better lasting results. For example, simply wanting to get in shape is too vague. Aim to fit it to the SMART criteria and make a more clear objective like take a walk for 30 min 5 times per week, for a month.",
    "onboardingHabitsTip": "    Habits are filling up about 45% of our daily activities - almost half of our lives we run on autopilot! Whether your goal is to develop a good habit or break a bad one, it takes some time for your brain to build new neural connections. Brain science suggests tying new habits to triggers, actions that you are already used to. For example, you can meditate every morning right after brushing your teeth. It will strengthen the neural pathways and with every repetition, your brain will require less effort to perform the right behavior.",
    "onboardingMindfulnessTip": "    Regular practice lowers your stress, helps build good relationships, improves focus and sleep, and even physical health. Harvard study shows that taking a few minutes to focus your mind each day can reduce pain, depression, and more.\n    The beauty and simplicity of meditation are that you don't need any equipment. Built-in mindfulness tools will help you make it a daily habit and you’ll notice the first changes in your mood, productivity, and stress level within just a couple of weeks of regular practice.",
    "descriptionHabitTip": "    A habit and a routine are both repeated regular activities. The distinction is that habits run on autopilot and routines are intentional. For instance, having coffee might be something you do every morning without awareness but doing morning exercise requires intention and effort.\nFirst, you need to hone and practice your routine and after sticking to it the habit-forming process will become automatic. The better you describe what action you want to perform, why, when, and under what circumstances, the bigger your chances to succeed. The human brain doesn't like uncertainty, so your desire \"I want to read more\" is unlikely becomes a habit while \"I will read for 30 min every night after dinner\" will.",
    "descriptionGoalTip": "   Scientists Yukl and Latham published research on interconnections between goal-setting and individual personality factors. It revealed that:\n    • Participants with difficult goals achieved greater success than others.\n    • Participants with higher self-esteem did better on task accomplishments.\n    • Participants with a greater understanding of why the goal was necessary for them had more chances of being successful with the target plans.\n    So dedicate some time to describe your goal in detail and it would help you to achieve it.",
    "keyResultsGoalTip": "   OKR (Objectives and Key Results) is the best goal-setting technique that consists of the two basic parts:\n    1. The Objective is a qualitative goal that tells you what you want to achieve.\n    2. The Key Results are quantitative and define how you’ll know if you have achieved them.\n    John Doerr’s who introduced Google to OKRs, offered the best formula for setting them: \n    I will (Objective) as measured by (This set of Key Results).\n    Set and review your goals quarterly.",
    "repetitionAndTriggersHabitTip": "   As a certain behavior is repeated multiple times, the neural connections in the brain form and become stronger. Therefore, with every repetition, our brain needs less effort to perform a habit. The habit loop coined by Charles Duhigg explains the habit formation process as a series of steps - trigger (or cue), craving, habit, and reward. The trigger for a habit can be anything that drives it such as a preceding action, an existing habit like brushing teeth, a location, a time of day, other people, or an emotional state. E.g. you can meditate every morning right after turning off the alarm.",
    "remindersHabitTip": "   Benjamin Gardner, a habit researcher and senior lecturer in psychology at King’s College London, states that when it comes to new habits, forgetting is a big issue that is why planning ahead and setting up reminders is a good idea. \n    Reminders for implementation intentions will increase their activation in declarative memory, but activation will decay as time goes by since those reminders were attended. So at the begging of formation a new habit, it's a great and the easiest tool to stay on track.",
    "prepareForSuccessHabitTip": "   When you start a journey of adopting a new habit, you need to set your mindset and think in advance about how you overcome challenges. We are only humans and can't perform to the fullest all the time. \n    The Two-Day Rule comes to the rescue. Never skip the thing you're trying to accomplish more than two days in a row - don’t slack off too much and often.\n    Let's say, you want to run. One day it's raining and you don't go. But the next day, you need to find a way to do this run - even if it means going to a gym instead of a park or buying a waterproof outfit. Once you get used to hitting your habits, you will do everything in your power not to miss two days in a row and break the chain.",
    "prepareForSuccessGoalTip": "   Your overall mindset dictates your success or failure and how you cope with challenges. Psychologists Daniel Gilbert and Timothy Wilson identify the key to setting goals is a better understanding and predicting your emotions, including how they’ll change over time, how external events will affect them, and how they’ll impact things like personal productivity.\n    Coaching questions in this section will help you work through any goal, set priorities, overcome doubts and challenges, and find support.",
    "detailsHabitTip": "   The human brain likes clarity therefore if you want to develop a habit, you should describe it as precisely as possible.\n    Add all relevant details, it will help you find focus and direction and build a solid daily routine.",
    "statisticsHabitTip": "   The process of building habits is all about consistency. Tracking your habits and measuring the progress help you correct your behavior, find areas for improvements, and celebrate the results. Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight are all more likely to improve than those who don’t. The calendar keeps you accountable, when you see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Also, tracking feels rewarding. It is great to watch your results grow and it boosts your motivation.",
    "statisticsGoalTip": "   If you are trying to achieve a goal, the more often that you monitor your progress, the greater the likelihood that you will succeed, according to research published by the American Psychological Association.\n    Your chances of success are even more likely if you report your progress publicly or physically record it. Feel free to share your progress with friends and focus your attention on the goal to keep it at the top of your mind.",
